<h1>Re-Evaluation</h1>

<p>After re-designing our prototype to take into account our findings from our initial evaluation, we decided to conduct a smaller study to find out the effectiveness of our changes. We found three new participants who had not used the previous prototype.The study had two stages, and it focused on the intuitiveness of the interface.<br>
</p>
<p>
In the first stage we gave the user the old prototype with no instruction on its use. In the second stage we gave the user the new prototype, again with no instruction. Before the second stage we did explain to the user that the next version they would be testing was different than the first though. During both stages the users listened to the scripted basketball events that we used during our initial evaluation.<br>
</p>
<p>
After completing both stages we asked our users to fill out a very short survey which asked these questions:<br>
<ul>
<li>From the first stage, please rank your ability to learn the system without being instructed. 1 is the slowest with 7 being the fastest.</li>
<li>From the second stage, please rank your ability to learn the system without being instructed. 1 is the slowest with 7 being the fastest.</li>
<li>From the first stage, please rate your perceived accuracy (how accurate do you think you were). 1 is the worst accuracy, and 7 is the best accuracy.</li>
<li>From the second stage, please rate your perceived accuracy (how accurate do you think you were). 1 is the worst accuracy, and 7 is the best accuracy.</li>
<li>Please provide any additional comments here.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Here is the results of our findings presented in a simple bar graph:</p>

<p>
The unanimous result confirmed our initial suspicions that our initial swipe gestured input was not intuitive. All of the users agreed that the tapping interface was more intuitive and was more accurate.<br>
</p>
<p>
The final prototype design is far come being complete. It really needs some more polish to become a working product. However it does fully demonstrate that our new novel basketball scoring system is a viable contender for a sellable product.<br>
