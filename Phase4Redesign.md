<h1>Redesign</h1>

<h2>Intuitiveness</h2>
Based on the study, one of the major problems that we found was that software is not intuitive. In the first trial, practically no one was able to record any events properly. This was due to the fact that our current software is not very intuitive. The first fix is to add a line that shows the user's dragging path. This extra feature tells the user that he or she is supposed to be dragging. During the first trial, most subjects tried to simply click on the buttons. If their fingers were drawing lines as they were being dragged around, the user would know to interact with the software through dragging and not clicks.

Another fix that needs to be implemented is to hide the menu when the user does not currently have a finger on the screen. This will also help with the intuitiveness of the software. If the user sees that the menus are disappearing when his fingers leave the screen, it will be more obvious that interactions are handled through dragging and not clicking. Implementing these fixes will not require much work and make our software much more intuitive. The cost of making these changes is almost insignificant.

We discussed these changes with our client, who also participated in the study. He notes that making these changes would greatly improve the intuitiveness of the system. He also pointed out that making the software more intuitive will not help improve an expert's user's experience with the software. Fortunately, these changes have no effect on how the software is used at an advanced level.

<h2>Lack of Feedback</h2>

In the comments, a lot of subjects were confused on whether or not the system properly registered the event. This was detrimental to the overall intuitiveness of the system and caused problems with usability in all three trials. When redesigning our software, we will definitely add some kind of feedback that informs the user when they have successfully generated an event and when they have failed. This would be easy to implement. The feedback will be mostly visual. When the user properly generates an event, the background screen will flash green to show that it was successful. If the user is in the middle of generating an event and cancels it by choice or by misplacement of the finger, the screen will flash red to let the user know that the event was not generated. This way, the user does not have to keep looking at the list of generated events. This will help the user save time and be quicker about recording events. Additionally, it should help with the overall intuitiveness of the software.

<h2>Distance Between Menus</h2>

One of the common complaints in the comments was that the distance between the two menus were too far. Several subjects claimed that this slowed down their ability to record events. We will redesign the menu system so that the second pop up menu is closer to the first. However, we will make sure that the menus don't appear too close together. This will make it difficult to accurately drag fingers around. The cost of making this change is minimal. We can easily alter the distance between menus and do more testing to find the ideal number. Our client was very indifferent about this change because he didn't have any complaints about the distance. He says that he does not mind if we move the menus closer.
