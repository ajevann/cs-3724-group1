<h1>Information Design Scenarios</h1>

<h2>Kenneth</h2>
<p>
Kenneth is the last minute replacement game recorder for Portsmouth High School's<br>
basketball team.  Before the game starts he is given an oppurtunity to familiarize<br>
himslef with the game reporting software. Initially he feels very uneasey since<br>
he knows how quickly the pace of a basketball game goes and he doesn't want to<br>
make mistakes.  Kenneth starts up the device and then is presented with the<br>
evening's line up on one half of the screen and the other half of the screen contains<br>
categories for the different statistics.  Kenneth starts out by touching one of<br>
the players, immediately the statistics fade away and he is presented with a menu<br>
which seems to grow out of the player's name into a serious of branches containing<br>
different basketball plays and events. Kenneth tries to tap the next menu item<br>
but the menu dissapears. He then re-taps the player and decides this time to<br>
drag his finger to the next item.  While doing so he notices the screen keeps track<br>
of his progress and plots a colored line indicating his path. When his finger<br>
reaches a menu item that doesn't spawn any more branches he is unsure of what to<br>
do and releases his finger inside the menu item.  As soon as he lifts his finger<br>
the new event is generated automatically from the path his finger created and the<br>
new event appears in the scrolling game log. Kenneth keeps familiarizing himself<br>
until he feels comfortable generating different events. Now he wants to try deleting<br>
old events.  Kenneth just happens to own an iPhone, and he tries the iOS method<br>
of deleting by swiping the game event in the scrolling log with his finger, just<br>
like iOS the event now shows a delete button which he taps and watches as the<br>
event vanishes.  After deleting all of his practice events the game gets underway.<br>
Kenneth is able to keep up with the pace of the game, and his speed at creating events<br>
keeps increasing as he becomes more familiar with the software. After making a simple<br>
mistake Kenneth learns that in order to fix the mistake all he must do is tap<br>
the errant event in the log and then re-swipe through an event and the new event<br>
replaces the old errant event. What Kenneth did not know what the event log had a<br>
built in buffer that kept newly created events from going out to the live feed for<br>
a specific period of time, and Kenneth managed to fix the event before it went live.<br>
After the game Kenneth is very proud of himself for learning the new software so<br>
quickly and for doing a great job.<br>
</p>

<p>
Our claim that the interface is easy to use is proven by Kenneth because he was<br>
able to quickly learn the new software even though he was a last minute replacement.<br>
This was partly due to the hands on nature of the menue interface and the way<br>
that it branches out like a tree and forces the user to make specific selections as<br>
they traverse the tree's branches and leaves; this validates our claim about menu selections<br>
pop out like a tree. Another claim, the reporter uses a touch screen, shows how natural<br>
and intuitive the process is when Kenneth takes an iOS gesture and applies it to the<br>
software and it behaves identically.<br>
</p>

<h2>Leo</h2>
<p>
Leo is the statistician for the Maroney University basketball team. The head coach<br>
has decided that they need a new game recording software and the new software they<br>
purchase from Zhang Industries comes with a in person demonstration and teaching<br>
session. During the session Leo is taught all the nifty and speedy ways that the<br>
software can generate game events. He quickly picks up on the patterns of the<br>
menu systems that sprout like growing trees. One of the tips he is told is that<br>
while creating a new event if he believes that he made a mistake but hasn't finished<br>
he could then remove his finger and the event would be cancelled. The instructor<br>
also explains to Leo how the buffer works before the event messages are sent to<br>
the live online public view. The instructor tells Leo that he has a limited time<br>
to edit an event before it goes public and show Leo how to properly select an event<br>
for editing.  Leo is a little worried that the system is too simple and that he wished<br>
there were more advanced settings for more expeirenced users. However after explaining<br>
the basics the instructor shows Leo all the menu subsystems in great detail.<br>
Leo is amazed that by just dragging his finger through the menues he can generate<br>
an event for almost every single situation encountered in the game. Its during this time<br>
that the instructor shows Leo how to record a player taking a shot. All he has to do is<br>
drag through a player's name to shot, then a view of the court will appear and when<br>
his finger stops on the court it marks the location of a shot and a menu appears around<br>
his finger asking if the shot was made and if a foul occured.  Leo really liked being<br>
able to mark a shot location and then have the shot event automatically generated as<br>
well. Once Leo actually uses the software during a game he is thoroughly impressed<br>
by the speed at which he can generate events.<br>
</p>

<p>
Leo also demonstrates the claim that the interface is easy to use when he<br>
wishes for more advanced features. Leo really liked the touch interface confirming<br>
the useage of a touch screen claim, especially when he could mark a shot on the court<br>
by dragging his finger to the location of the shot and then being able to have the<br>
shot details show up in a menu. This is also where another claim is proven, the system can<br>
generate messages for almost every situation. Leo realizes the how powerful the shot marking<br>
tool is because the procedure is quick for him and he can stay current with the game, but<br>
it also provides more detailed info for the users at home watching the game feed.<br>

<h2>Jon</h2>
<p>
Jon is the statistician for the Dubai Sheiks, a professional mens basketball team.  He<br>
has been using different game recording softwares and is very adept at learning new<br>
softwares to get his job done. Jon is very passionate about his job and he really<br>
learns the ins and outs of the systems that provide him his livelyhood.  Jon has just<br>
transistioned to the new touch interface and its accompanying software. So far he is<br>
thoroughly surprised at the speedy interface. He was initially worried that online users<br>
would miss out on some of the idiosyncracies of the game as well as color commentary. He<br>
learned in his training that by tapping directly into the event log he could create a blank<br>
event that would pull up a keyboard so he could directly type into the event. This allowed<br>
him to be able to theoretically report on off court antics, fights, incredible plays, and<br>
other events the software didn't account for. Another feature that Jon really liked, and<br>
so did the head coach, is how the software saves the event log to a text file that can<br>
easily be archived and reviewed after the game. This archive allowed Jon to go back<br>
and review his accuracy on the game, and it allowed the coach to have a text version of<br>
the game to go along with the statistics.<br>
</p>

<p>
Jon demonstrates the claim that the software allows the user to make custom events when<br>
he learns how to tap into the event log to create a custom event. This allows him to<br>
create events that the software couldn't / didn't take into account. The final claim where<br>
the software saves the event log is also demonstrated. It really benifits the head coach<br>
having the full transcript of the game events.<br>
