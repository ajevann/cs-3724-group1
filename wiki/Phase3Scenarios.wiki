<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This page contains our interaction design scenarios, as well as a short description of how the scenario addresses the problem, activity or information design claims' upsides and downsides. The scenarios contain links to specific claims on the claims page, as in the usability case studies library.</p>


<h2> Kenneth </h2>

<p>It is the Friday night basketball game at Portsmouth High School against rivals Middleton High 
School and the gymnasium is packed. The school has overbooked the gym and due to the incredible 
demand to view the game, the administrators have decided to present a live game cast of the 
important rivalry match up on the schoolâ€™s website. Principal Jack Donaghy is in a frenzy to 
find a replacement for the usual score recorder, Pete Hornberger. Instead, he resorts to using 
Kenneth Parcell to act as his temporary recorder for the game cast. Alas! Kenneth has never before 
seen the software used by the school. Kenneth is afraid that he might
not be able to take care of the intensity and speed that will be required to record the basketball game. 
He stares into the screen and sees all of the player's names 
already listed. He presses on a player and a slew of options comes up. As Kenneth drags his fingers 
across the screen, more menus pop up like an oak tree. He plays around with the interface for two 
minutes before the game starts and quickly gets used to it. Before the game, he clears out all of 
the fake messages he generated. As the game starts, Kenneth is very determined to keep up with the 
fast pace of the game. Fortunately, the software is very easy to use. Kenneth quickly becomes 
familiar with the movements and generates a lot of very accurate events that describe how the game 
is going. After a few minutes, Kenneth is more familiar with the interface and button placement. 
He is able to generate most of the plays now without looking at the screen. He simply drags his fingers
across the screen to generate the events. Unfortuantely, he makes a 
mistake at one point and panics. Fortunately, there is a foul shot immediately 
after so Kenneth was able to go back and edit the event before it went live. All the messages he
generated were placed in a text list to the right of the screen. Simply by tapping it, he was able
to edit and correct the event. By the end of the game, 
Kenneth is exhausted. Fortunately, he was able to accurately report each event in the game and no 
riots occured. Everyone went home and lived happily ever after.</p>

<p>This scenario helps to illustrate the ease with which the interface can be manipulated. With relative simplicity, the interface can be controlled. This addresses the problem of the high learning curve of traditional systems that have a complex interface any many buttons and menus. In addition, the new interface is fast to use and very easy to adjust to. After a short period of time, users should become familiar with the button placements. This will help speed up the generation of the events and help the user keep his eyes on the game so he or she doesn't miss anything important.</p>


<h2>Mistake Editing</h2>

<p>With ten minutes left in the second half, Tony is in the heat of recording. He has done well up to this point but has become overwhelmed with the excitement and work that has gone into recording. Unfortunately for him, he lapses for a moment and doesn't pay attention to what he does. He makes a slight mistake which causes the referees to second guess themselves on a call after reviewing with the scorekeeper and Tony (One of the referees, Pierre-Luigi Colina, is a minute amnesiac). They end up ejecting the star player unfairly and Tony is in a bind to fix his mistake. He quickly uses the edit function on the right side of the window and corrects the mistake before the referee figures out what happened. Tony sighs in relief. He still has his two fingers.</p>

<p>This scenario illustrates the use and effectiveness of the edit and correction function of the interface. With this ability, Tony was able to quickly correct a costly mistake before anyone could question him and the veracity of the mistake, saving him some fingers. </p>
