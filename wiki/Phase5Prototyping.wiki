<h1>Prototyping</h1>
<p>
After thoroughly examining our study results, it became very obvious that a serious design flaw was present. This flaw really became apparent during our initial study stage. In this stage the user was not instructed in how to use the software. This stage measured the intuitiveness of the software, and our results were dismal. In every case, except one, the user could not figure out how to generate game events. The problem was the input gesture. We designed our system to accept a prolonged swipe between input targets, and almost every user tried to tap the target inputs. Aside from this major issue we only had some other minor issues with our prototype.
</p>
<p>
These other minor issues mainly focused with the way information was presented to the user. In our initial design we decided that careful use of information hiding would focus the user into different workflows.  The design called for menus to “flow” out of each other while simultaneously hiding previous non-selected menus and irrelevant menu options.  This effect would literally look like a tree limb branching apart until a leaf was reached. Because the nature of this effect would involve a larger effort than what was available we scaled back the effect into a simpler series of views that pop open when the initial target calls them.  We violated our initial design by not hiding irrelevant menu options and also reused the initial menu location. By reusing the initial menu location we did not successfully re-create the smooth workflow that we initially imagined.
</p>
<p>
After reviewing this information, our group decided on a prototype redesign which includes:
<ul>
<li>Switch input gestures from swiping to tapping.</li>
<li>Implement the proper information hiding, hide irrelevant menu options.</li>
<li>Implement all menu locations as per the original design specification</li>
</ul>
</p>
	
<p>
Finally here are the redesign screen shots:

<span>Here is the initial screen, not much has changed here.</span>

<span>Here the user has tapped a player. Notice how the other player's disappear from view and the game event options are shown.</span>
<img src="http://cs-3724-group1.googlecode.com/files/new_prototype-3.png" />
<span>Here the user has selected a game event, and now they are presented with a menu of only relevant and applicable choices.</span>
	
</p>
<p>
Once the redesign was complete we decided to do a small study based on the changes we made. We found three new participants who had not used the previous prototype. The study had two stages, and it focused on the intuitiveness of the interface. 
</p>
<p>
In the first stage we gave the user the old prototype with no instruction on its use. In the second stage we gave the user the new prototype, again with no instruction. Before the second stage we did explain to the user that the next version they would be testing was different than the first though. During both stages the users listened to the scripted basketball events that we used during our initial evaluation.
</p>
<p>
After completing both stages we asked our users to fill out a very short survey which asked these questions:
<ul>
<li>From the first stage, please rank your ability to learn the system without being instructed. 1 is the slowest with 7 being the fastest.</li>
<li>From the second stage, please rank your ability to learn the system without being instructed. 1 is the slowest with 7 being the fastest.</li>
<li>From the first stage, please rate your perceived accuracy (how accurate do you think you were). 1 is the worst accuracy, and 7 is the best accuracy.</li>
<li>From the second stage, please rate your perceived accuracy (how accurate do you think you were). 1 is the worst accuracy, and 7 is the best accuracy.</li>
<li>Please provide any additional comments here.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The unanimous result confirmed our initial suspicions that our initial swipe gestured input was not intuitive. All of the users agreed that the tapping interface was more intuitive and was more accurate.
</p>
<p>
The final prototype design is far come being complete. It really needs some more polish to become a working product. However it does fully demonstrate that our new novel basketball scoring system is a viable contender for a sellable product.
