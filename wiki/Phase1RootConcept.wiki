<h1>Phase 1 Root Concept</h1>

<h2>Vision</h2>
<p>
    A game recorder interface for professional basketball that will be have an intuitive, efficient, and quick interface to
    update remote fans on live game changes via the web.
</p>

<h2>Basic Rationale</h2>
<p>
    Basketball are very fast paced. The recorder must be able to keep up with the
    pace of the game or information will not be conveyed to the fans in a timely
    manner. The interface can help by eliminating repetitive tasks, removing 
    complicated tasks, aiding accuracy, and updating a lot of different data with
    simple actions.
</p>

<h2>Other Concepts Considered</h2>
<ul>
<li>
    Providing a very in depth interface with the greatest possible number of choices
    of possible player outcomes.
</li>
<li>
    Each player has their own individual reporter that writes about the players actions
    and statistics.
</li>
<li>
    Create a speech to text interface that looks for certain key words and generates a
    play by play report.
</li>
<li>
    Stream an audio broadcast of the game from the recorder's point of view.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Arival at our Rationale</h2>
<p>
    We looked at what kind of information needed to be recorded, how the speed of
    the game influences the client's interaction with the system, and also the
    information the fans would like to see. We identified some key properties that
    our system must have: speed, intuitiveness, and accuracy. These properties will
    ensure that fans have a good picture of what is going on in the game while not
    being able to view the game directly.
