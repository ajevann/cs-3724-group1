<h2>Questionnaire Summary:</h2>
<p>
The aim of the questionnaire was primarily to learn exactly what types of statistics and events the end users expected from the system. Secondarily it was to investigate what types of computing systems people in general prefer.
Our questionnaire resulted in a list of events or statistics that we could sort into high, medium, and low priority events. High priority events included two-point shots, three-point shots, layups, fouls, assists, possession changes ,and timeouts. 
Medium priority events included steals, misses, blocks, dunks, and highlight events (i.e. windmill dunks). Low priority events included passes, and rebounds.

<h2>Client Interview Summary:</h2>
<p>
Our interview with the client gave us a good deal of information about that major issues that effect basketball recordings. 
Primarily of concern was the speed of the game and how that influences the recorder's ability to remedy any mistakes made. Our client talked about how it greatly irritated him to have to go back and fix any mistakes he might have 
made during the game, and how he can only really do that during timeouts or penalty shots. The client stressed the need for a system that could not only create but also easily manipulate events quickly and without much 
attention or thought as both are in high demand while trying to record the events of a game.
</p>
<p>
Also of concern was the method of input, our client has extensive training and practice in keyboard use and that currently is what he feels most comfortable with, along with touch devices.
