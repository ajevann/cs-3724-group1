<h2>Field Data Summary</h2>
<br>
<h3>Game Events and Expectations</h3>
<p>
The data we collected during our field studies gave us a good picture of the requirements for this project.
It quickly became obvious during our field studies that the system must be as engaging to end users as possible.
The end goal of several stakeholders (recorder, team), entertaining the end user, was one of the driving issues in our analysis (See Stakeholder Profiles). 
Since for that to happen the system must be able to generate and transmit events in such a way as to appeal to the end user.

There are a lot of thing going on during a basketball game. Such events can range from the game itself to the players talking trash and side line events drawing our attention. 
One of the main goals during our requirements analysis was to see what type of events occur during a basketball game and their relevance to the end user. This is key to support the above mentioned expectation of the team. 
Between our questionnaire and our interview with our client we developed a list of the events that are important to the user (See questionnaire). One of the simplest examples of such an event is scoring.

Scoring however is not as simple as it sounds to record. There are various ways to score points in basketball, including two point shots, three point shorts, layups, slam dunks, free throws, etc (See Artifacts Paper Record).
Talks with our client and examination of several artifacts showed recording all the possible ways to score points can be confusing, requiring many fields that need to be kept track of. Considering point scoring alone, a 
recording system must have a lot of options and configurations if it aims at providing detailed and engaging information.

<h2>Questionnaire Summary:</h2>
<p>
The aim of the questionnaire was primarily to learn exactly what types of statistics and events the end users expected from the system. Secondarily it was to investigate what types of computing systems people in general prefer.
Our questionnaire resulted in a list of events or statistics that we could sort into high, medium, and low priority events. High priority events included two-point shots, three-point shots, layups, fouls, assists, possession changes ,and timeouts. 
Medium priority events included steals, misses, blocks, dunks, and highlight events (i.e. windmill dunks). Low priority events included passes, and rebounds.

<h2>Client Interview Summary:</h2>
<p>
Our interview with the client gave us a good deal of information about that major issues that effect basketball recordings. 
Primarily of concern was the speed of the game and how that influences the recorder's ability to remedy any mistakes made. Our client talked about how it greatly irritated him to have to go back and fix any mistakes he might have 
made during the game, and how he can only really do that during timeouts or penalty shots. The client stressed the need for a system that could not only create but also easily manipulate events quickly and without much 
attention or thought as both are in high demand while trying to record the events of a game.
</p>
<p>
Also of concern was the method of input, our client has extensive training and practice in keyboard use and that currently is what he feels most comfortable with, along with touch devices.
