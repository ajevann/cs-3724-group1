<h2>Interview Transcript:</h2>

This is an interview with our client. He currently keeps track of play by play events at basketball games for personal use. We did two separate interviews. The information from the first interview was recorded while the information from the second was written down. The full transcript of the second interview follows. Below that, there is a link to the audio of the first interview.<br>
<br><br>
<p>
Q: When you are recording a game, how costly are mistakes?<br>
<br>
They are very costly. It would also piss off a ton of people who are watching or looking up that kind of<br>
information online as well.<br>
<br>
Q: If you could easily retract that mistake, do you think that would be a lot better?<br>
<br>
Yeah if I could delete it I would definitely edit it if I could. If I made a mistake I would definitely want to<br>
correct it.<br>
<br>
Q: During basketball games, do you think that there are times of pauses that would let you fix your<br>
mistakes?<br>
<br>
Yes. During foul shots, there is usually enough time to correct any mistakes. Time outs and commercial<br>
breaks are even better for this because they last longer.<br>
<br>
Q: And how often do these things happen in games?<br>
<br>
Like every other sport broadcast on TV, this happens quite often. The action is very intermittent.<br>
<br>
Q: How does the speed of the game affect your ability to accurately record?<br>
<br>
Basketball is very quick. You have to be very fast to respond to what is happening. Possessions can<br>
change and switch in an instant. They have a lot of fast breaks and the distance from one end of the<br>
court to the other is very short. It only takes a few seconds to move across. It’s very quick.<br>
<br>
Q: Has your ability to record the game ever been slowed down by the interface?<br>
<br>
The answer is no, not at all. I only say that because I took a typing class and know how to type. I don’t<br>
need to look at the keys while I’m typing. I can look at the keys and watch the game at the same time. I<br>
only need to go over and check what I typed and fix typos. This can get annoying though because when I<br>
am looking over what I have written my eyes are not on the game. I can only do this during a break.<br>
<br>
Q: Even though a lot of things can happen within a short period of time, you can still keep up with the<br>
typing?<br>
<br>
The thing that you have to realize is that I do this in grammatically incorrect sentences. I write down the<br>
shortest amount just to get the point across. It’s very to the point.<br>
<br>
Q: How hard do you think it is to recover from a mistake or a lag?<br>
<br>
This depends on many factors. It varies based on the play that is happening. There are a lot of times<br>
in the game when pauses are made. Then, I can catch up to the point. When I’m behind 2 seconds, a<br>
simple foul can really help me out.<br>
<br>
Q: On a scale of 1 to 10, how stressful do you think it is to keep up with live updates?<br>
<br>
Well, if 10 is the equivalent of pulling your hair out, I’d say it’s around 6 or 7. That’s because you have to<br>
write down a lot of information for four quarters consecutively. That’s a lot of writing for about 2 or 2.5<br>
hours. Also, you need to constantly pay attention for the entire time.<br>
<br>
Q: Do you think it would be helpful to swap someone out? Would it be nice to have 2 people switching<br>
off?<br>
<br>
If you can have shifts, then I would absolutely think so.<br>
<br>
Q: What computing platforms are you most familiar with?<br>
<br>
I am most familiar with Windows and Blackberry. I also have a lot of experience using Android and iOS<br>
tablets.<br>
<br>
Q: What computing device do you most prefer?<br>
<br>
I would prefer a laptop or a tablet just because they are very mobile.<br>
<br>
Q: What methods of input do you have most experience with?<br>
<br>
I have the most experience with keyboards and touch screens.<br>
<br>
Q: What kind of distractions do you come across during a game?<br>
<br>
Obviously the audience is a pretty big distraction. The referees and players can be distractions as well.<br>
This depends mostly on where I am situated. It makes a difference if I am sitting on the floor or sitting<br>
up on a balcony. A lot of it deals with perception.<br>
<br>
Q: How do these distractions affect your job?<br>
<br>
If I can’t see the players clearly or if I can’t tell what’s going on, then the information that the online<br>
audience is going to see is going to be inaccurate or incomplete. I need a good first person view of the<br>
game.<br>
