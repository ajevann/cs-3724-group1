<h1>Prototyping</h1>

The prototype went through some considerable changes. As a reminder, the prototype is a functioning iPad application. Here is a list of changes made to the prototype:

<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where a duplicate player showed up when selecting a player on a different team.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the event menu would not disappear after a user made a mistake.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the dragging interface would get confused.</li>
<li>Moved the event menu farther away to facilitate more accuracy when choosing an action.</li>
<li>Added the ability to note if a possession change has happened.</li>
<li>Added the ability to delete an event from the plays table.</li>
<li>Added the ability to edit an event by tapping upon it and then over writing it with a new event.</li>
</ul>

<p>Notice the changed team and player selection area are larger and the coloring makes identification and selection easier. Also note the possession buttons above the action menu as well as the new placement of the action menu.<p>

<h3>New Edit Feature</h3>

<p>Once a user has identified a mistake, they simply tap on the entry in error and then create a new event that will overwrite the selected entry.</p>

<h3>New Delete Feature</h3>

<p>If a user doesn't need to edit an event and it is a complete error, the user may swipe their finger from left to right on the event in question which will then bring up a delete button. Upon tapping of the delete button the event will be removed from the game plays table.</p>
